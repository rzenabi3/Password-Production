## Description-of-Code

* The main focus of this project is to debug a previously written code that allows browser application users to create a password that is not only secure but also uniqe in nature. Each password constructed from this application consists of randomly selected uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric digits as well as common keyboard symbols. Permitting users to fabricate new passwords upon request. Password lengths are restricted to an 8 character limit and selected at random, at no point will users have the ability to change any part of the randomly produced password. Instead they are required to allow the browser application to completely reproduce an entirely new password.
